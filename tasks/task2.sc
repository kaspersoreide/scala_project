    // The output is either 0, 1 and 2; 2 is the most common output. We're talking about one 1 or 0 out hundreds kind of
    // rare. This happens because the order of execution of threads is not, as least as it currently is written,
    // determined in advance. Different orderings result in different behaviour. This is called race conditions. It is
    // often problematic because the designer did not account for the possibility of such events unfolding. An example
    // of this kind of error might be that a message is attempted sent without the content being initialized, which will
    // either crash or lead to a nonsensical message.

    // The purpose of the `increaseCounter` method is to increment the field counter. Which means, the only way it "fails"
    // is if you call it n times and counter does not increase by n. Making it thread-safe is not inherently connected to
    // race conditions. Thread interference might cause incorrect behaviour. `counter += 1` is short for
    // `counter = counter + 1`. My knowledge of the inner workings of the JVM is not good enough to determine if the
    // incremented value of `counter` is cached for a split second before it is saved into `counter`. If this is the case,
    // Two instances of the method `increaseCounter` starting execution at the same time might both cache the same initial
    // `counter` value, increment it, and both write the same incremented value into `counter`. This would mean that
    // running the method twice resulted in `counter` only being increased by one. If this is possible, the method is not
    // thread-safe. The `counter` field is private, so can only be changed from within the `Task2` object. This means
    // adding `this.synchronized` before the body of the `incrementCounter` method will make it thread-safe. Only one
    // instance of the method can run at a time, leaving no chance for interleaving reading and assignments to and from
    // `counter`.

    // def increaseCounter(): Unit = this.synchronized({
    //   counter += 1
    // })

    // A deadlock is when two or more executions are blocked by each other in such a way that execution just stops. In
    // many cases, this blocking is related to resource access. It can be avoided by
